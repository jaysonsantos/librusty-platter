# librusty-platter
## What is it?
This is supposed to be a folder encryption lib which supports plugabble filesystems (could be local FS, Amazon S3, Dropbox) and plugable frontends (fuse, http or just as a lib to be embeded). In the end it looks pretty much like encfs but written mainly in rust.
## Warning
This is also working as playground to learn more about encryption and rust so, I wouldn't suggest if for real usage.
## What works
- Local directory initialization
- Folder creation
